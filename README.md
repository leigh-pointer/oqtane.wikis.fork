# Wiki Module

This module allows an authorized user to create wiki pages which include title and content. Content can contain HTML formatting, links, and images. The module utilizes standard wiki syntax to enable authors to use [[Link]] tags to create new wiki pages which are linked to the current page. Links are converted automatically into permalinks to preserve navigation. All versions of wiki content are preserved for historical reference, allowing rollback to previous versions. The module provides custom templating capabilities so that you can customize the display to suit your needs. It has search functionality so that users can easily locate a specific wiki page by keyword. It supports site maps so that the blog entries are indexable by search engines. An RSS feed is also available for content syndication.
